# Credit Risk Analysis

# Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to apply multiple machine learning algorithms and assess which model produces the best results for the given credit dataset [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/nsmeltz/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/0f3846712b105e79d36c388d4bdbc2354fadf271/LoanStats_2019Q1.csv).

# Results 

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

# Summary 

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
