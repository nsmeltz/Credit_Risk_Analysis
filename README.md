# Credit Risk Analysis

# Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to apply 6 machine learning algorithms and assess which model produces the best results for the given [credit dataset](https://github.com/nsmeltz/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/0f3846712b105e79d36c388d4bdbc2354fadf271/LoanStats_2019Q1.csv).

# Results 

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

### I. Resampling with Logistic Regression Modeling

  - ### A) Oversampling
    - Random Oversampling
  
    - SMOTE Oversampling

  ### B) Undersampling
    - ### Cluster Centroid Undersampling

  ### C) Combination Sampling
